You are building a small console-based application for a library. The library has three types of books available for rent: Fiction, Non-Fiction, and Magazine. The rent cost is based on the number of days a user wants to rent the book. The rent prices per day for each type of book are as follows:
Fiction: $1.50 per day Non-Fiction: $2.00 per day Magazine: $1.00 per day
