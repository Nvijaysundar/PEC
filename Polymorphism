Question 1:
1-Design a class Circle having radius(type float) as a instance variable and make
following member methods
a) Zero argument and parameterized constructors
b) Override String toString() method return radius of Circle object
c) Override boolean equals(Object object) method to check that two circle
object are same or not.
d) Write method that will return area of Circle(no argument)
e) Write method that will take one Circle object as argument and return its area.

Question2:
2- Design a class Point with two double x and y as instance variable such that object of
this class will represent a point of coordinate system and make following member
methods.
a) Zero argument and parameterized constructors
b) Write a method that will take one Point as argument and print its quadrant or lies on
X-axis or Y-axis or origin
c) Write a method that will take two Point as a argument and return center point of
these points
d) Write a method that will take two Point as a argument and return distance between
these points
e) Write a method that will take three Point as a argument and return 1 if they are in
straight line otherwise return 0
f) Override String toString() to return values of Point
